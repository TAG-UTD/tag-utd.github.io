Hello everyone! So just to let yall know, we have released videos for ALL past
meetings, and they are located in our [youtube][1] channel. Feel free to look at
those if you happened to miss one of our meetings.

We also have powerpoint slides for each week shared on [google drive][2], 
(including this week's slides, if you want to preview them). This folder also
contain handouts that we pass in class and instructions for using certain
things.

We hope to see you in our next meeting today!
