Good evening everyone!

This week we are meeting as usual on Wednesday at 8:15 PM in ECSS 2.201. This
week I promise you it will be very interesting! We are going to reversing a
program, and we will try to exploit the program, make it do something that it
was not designed to do!

I will be doing a two segment presentation on Wednesday. The first segment will
actually be presented in CSG (located at MC 2.410), which starts at 7 pm, and
the second segment will be presented at our meeting. Don't worry, the segments
are designed so that if you miss the first segment, you will not get lost if you
just come to TAG for the second segment.

We hope to see you there!

If you missed last week, here is [last week's
