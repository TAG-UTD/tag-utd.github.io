Today we finished the assembly program that took a list of arrays and summed the
values. Here's the [code link][/files/loops.asm] of our completed code with
comments. If you have any questions about it please PM or email me.

We also started looking at [IDA pro][1]. Please do download IDA pro <u>on the
VM</u> before next week, and if you can go and play around with it. We might be
looking at some problems from [RPISEC's MBE labs][2]. Please, at least download
(or clone) the repo to the VM so we can look at it next week right away.

Also if you can try out with cracking lab1A of MBE... if you can't solve it,
it is okay because we will be going through this next week. Here's a hint: you
will have to type a correct username and/or password and then you will get an
authenticated message, and you will also get a shell. Once you get this... you
win.

As always no experience is needed (but it would be nice) as I would be more than
happy to slow down to help you understand this hard assembly sh\*t.

We hope to see you next week!
