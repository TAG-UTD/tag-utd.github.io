Hello everyone!

We are meeting again Wednesday 8:15 PM in ECSS 2.201. Does being able to read
the sacred code of x86 sound *interesting* to you? What about trying to understand
what common-day applications are ACTUALLY doing under the hood? Find out more in
our next meeting as we talk about some introduction to the art of reverse
engineering.

We hope to see you there! As always, if you cannot show up to the meeting we
will always post a video shortly after the meeting documenting our meeting.
