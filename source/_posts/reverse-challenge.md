Hey there everyone!

Tomorrow we are meeting as usual in ECSS 2.201 at Wednesday 8:15! We will be
walking through an interesting reverse engineering challenge. This week we will
have some interactive fun!

This week we will be trying something new: we will creating a live stream video
on our Youtube channel, so that if can't join us in person, you can still watch
our videos in live time!

Here is the [link to the video][1]

We hope to see you there!
